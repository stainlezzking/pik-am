        <li aria-level="2"><strong>User </strong><strong>Content.</strong> Our Services allow Users to share certain information with other Users of the Services in the PIK-AM investor forums. Specifically, our Services host investor forums, which are private online collaboration rooms accessible only to the Users who have invested in a specific offering, the sponsor of the offering, and PIK-AM. The primary purpose of each forum is to enable Users who invested in the offering to communicate and collaborate with each other regarding the offering, investment performance, market conditions, industry trends, and other asset-related topics pertinent to the specific offering. Users of these investor forums may share their contact information with other Users in the same investor forum to communicate outside of the Services. Your name, username, and other profile information will always be viewable and searchable by other Users. Although this content is public by default, below in the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy, we describe the controls that you can use, along with other relevant settings associated with your account, to limit the sharing of certain information. We are not responsible for the other users’ use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post or how you identify yourself on the Services.</li>
        <li aria-level="2"><strong>Investment Sponsors.</strong> If you indicate an interest in making an investment through the Services, such as indicating an interest to buy equity or make a loan in a particular private real estate company, we will notify the party or parties offering the investment and their affiliates (the “Issuer”) of your interest and may notify other Users with whom you have chosen to share information. Note that, upon your admission to an investment offering (a "Company"), the Issuer may share information including, but not limited to, member names, initial capital contributions, and distribution amounts with other members of the Company. Please refer to the terms of the Company's operating agreement and relevant state law for additional detail.</li>
        <li aria-level="2"><strong>Social Networks and Other Online Services. </strong>Our Services allow you to, upon your direction, share information with social networking services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

We encourage you to review their privacy policies.&nbsp;</li>
