    </ul>
    <p><strong>6. Modifications of the Website and Services.</strong> PIK reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Website, Services, and/or certain features at any time, temporarily or permanently, without notice to you. PIK will have no liability for any change to the Website or Services or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Website or Services.&nbsp; PIK modifies the content on the Website from time to time, but makes no representation that the content is always complete or up to date.&nbsp; We are under no obligation to update such material or provide user support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>7. Securities Products</strong>. Investment opportunities offered and/or purchased on the Website generally are “<strong>Securities</strong>” under federal law.&nbsp; The Securities are offered and/or managed by the issuer of the Securities (the “<strong>Issuer</strong>”) or an affiliate or third party sponsor (the “<strong>Sponsor</strong>”).&nbsp; Unless otherwise provided in the governing documents of each Securities offering, the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance, among other exemptions, on the exemptive provisions of Regulation D under the Securities Act. No governmental agency has reviewed the Securities and no state or federal agency has passed upon either the adequacy of the disclosure contained herein or the fairness of the terms of any offering.&nbsp; The Securities are only suitable for investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risks associated with private investments, including the risk of complete loss of your investment. Securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded and, therefore, are illiquid unless registered with the SEC. Additionally, the Securities may be subject to restrictions on resale or transfer including holding period requirements. Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity need, and long-term commitments. You must be able to afford to lose your entire investment. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.<br><br>Content provided on the Website has been prepared without reference to any particular investment requirements or the financial situation of any person or entity.&nbsp; YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEKING THE ADVICE OF A QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY PROFESSIONAL BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING YOUR BUSINESS AND/OR INVESTMENTS. Featuring or posting on the Website or via the Services of any opportunity or Security does not constitute a recommendation by PIK that you invest in that Security or a representation of the quality of any potential investment. PIK does not recommend or endorse any particular issuer, sponsor of an investment opportunity, or an investment in any particular investment, except as may occur under the terms of an Advisory Agreement you execute separately with PIK Advisors.&nbsp;<br><br>In cases where a third party is the Sponsor and/or Issuer of an investment opportunity, the third party, and not PIK, is responsible for compliance with exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“<strong>Investment Company Act</strong>”), as well as any other applicable laws.<br><br>These risks are non-exhaustive and are intended to highlight certain risks associated with investing in securities that are not registered with the SEC. In addition to reviewing <a href="https://5438855.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5438855/legal/hub/Investment%20Risks%20Disclosure%205.25.2022.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Investment Risks Disclosure</span></a>.&nbsp; We strongly advise you to consult a legal, tax and financial professional before investing, and carefully review all the specific risk disclosures provided as part of any offering materials and ask the issuer any questions you may have or request additional information.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Third-Party Information. </strong>The Website contents include information provided by third parties. Most of the information on the Securities is provided by third-party investment Sponsors. While PIK continually endeavors to provide reasonably and materially correct information, PIK cannot verify or guarantee the accuracy or completeness of all information provided by third parties. PIK makes no representation, warranty, or assurance that any information posted on the Website or through the Services concerning or by third parties is accurate or complete and has no responsibility or liability for that information.&nbsp; PIK disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by any User or anyone who may be informed of the content.&nbsp; All statements and/or opinions expressed in third party content are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity providing the third party content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>9. User Interactions and Disagreements</strong>. The Website may allow you to interact with investment Issuers or Sponsors and other Users. You acknowledge that third party investment Issuers and Sponsors and other Users are not affiliated with or controlled by PIK or its affiliates.

    <p><strong>10. Indemnity. </strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Website and the Services, and you will defend and indemnify PIK and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the “<strong>PIK Entities</strong>”) from and against every claim, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or connected with: (a) your use of, or misuse of, the Website and Services; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms of Use, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms of Use, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (d) any dispute, issue, or agreement between you and any third party, or (e) any interactions between or agreements between you and another User or any third party.
